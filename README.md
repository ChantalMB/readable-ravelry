# Readable Ravelry

In the process of updating and modernizing their website, [Ravelry](https://www.ravelry.com/) changed its palette to a theme that, while charming, made the site inaccessible to many of those who struggle light themes. If you struggle to use the new Ravelry&mdash; whether its due to eyestrain or seizure triggers&mdash; fear no more (hopefully)!

This is a simple browser extension which applies the [Solarized Dark](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) palette to much of Ravelry, making it more readable for those who may be triggered by light/brightness. Everything is very low contrast&mdash; the palette was designed purposefully to reduce brightness contrast&mdash; and overall I have made the website dark with specific focus on the most used pages (ex. the advanced search page).

I'm not a professional when it comes to web design&mdash; in fact, my major is history and my **minor** is computer science, so I'm barely a student in it! Due to this, I anticipate that this extension has some imperfections that I'm not spotting; [here's a form](https://forms.gle/fHaxTqVwdk3KVRAE8) you can submit any comments/feedback to and I'll address any issues when I get a chance!

### Current Known Issues
- Advance search pages seem to have white block near bottom of the page —> presently unsure of how to fix it, cannot find element in HTML
- Advanced button on project page —> not consistent with theme because my attempts to get the text to change colour have been futile

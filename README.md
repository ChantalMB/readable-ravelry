# Readable Ravelry

In the process of updating and modernizing their website, [Ravelry](https://www.ravelry.com/) changed its palette to a theme that, while charming, made the site inaccessible to many of those who struggle light themes. If you struggle to use the new Ravelry&mdash; whether its due to eyestrain or seizure triggers&mdash; fear no more (hopefully)!

This is a simple browser extension which applies the [Solarized Dark](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) palette to much of Ravelry, making it more readable for those who may be triggered by light/brightness. Everything is very low contrast&mdash; the palette was designed purposefully to reduce brightness contrast&mdash; and overall I have made the website dark with specific focus on the most used pages (ex. the advanced search page).

I'm not a professional when it comes to web design&mdash; in fact, my major is history and my **minor** is computer science, so I'm barely a student in it! Due to this, I anticipate that this extension has some imperfections that I'm not spotting; [here's a form](https://forms.gle/fHaxTqVwdk3KVRAE8) you can submit any comments/feedback to and I'll address any issues when I get a chance!

### UPDATE:
As of March 24th 2020, Ravelry now has its own official dark mode! Feel free to continue to use this extension if you prefer the palette, I'll certainly be keeping it available in the Chrome and Firefox stores, but I will not be updating this little project further. Thank you for using it, I'm happy I was able to help some of y'all!
